                <p class="description1">PCPartPicker did a good job on their website mobile view on utilizing the white space by adding some paddings on the buttons,
                    spaces between elements and icons. The spacing was able to make the  website readable and it gives the reader the indication 
                    that a new idea is being presented by adding white space between paragraphs. The padding in the button was able to guide the reader's 
                    eye to where  the call to action needs to be clicked to get started on their services. The spacing also improved focus and it was 
                    easier to read as there are only fewer elements in the website. Instead of making the website crowded with information, they have 
                    utilized white space and clean design to make their website more user-friendly.</p>

                <p class="description2"> Razer's website has always been dark and green in color and they should make the font color stand  out to be readable which they did. 
                    The white font color and black background is always preferred for the text to be readable create importance. The bright green against black 
                    has a higher contrast and it presents their brand successfully and one example is their logo at the very top. </p>

                <p class="description3">The alignment in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' website creates an organized design on all the elements. 
                    Although there are no paragraphs here to align them with the images, it is also designed for people who scan like the letter "F" since the 
                    title is aligned left and the elements below that are organized and visually appealing. </p>
